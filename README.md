# Bootstrap Multiplayer Setup
This is the official repository for the Bootstrap Multiplayer Setup.

This setup aims to fix all issues with Stronghold Crusader multiplayer, via game modifications.

v1.9.9a

Not a finished product - the setup is still undergoing development.

### Quick Start
The setup only works with version 1.41 of the game and modifies the Extreme executable.
If you already own the game, you can check your version in the game's main menu, under the exit gate.
If you happen to have an older version of the game, you can update for free using the [FireFly patch](http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html).
If you don't own the game yet, you can buy the current newest version from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40970/Stronghold_Crusader_HD/).

Make sure to back up your game folder by copying it elsewhere before installing.

Download the [Bootstrap Installer](https://github.com/CIO61/SHCE_Bootstrap_Installer/releases/latest/download/BootstrapInstaller.exe), insert the installer into your game folder and run it. It will automatically download and install everything that's needed.
The installer also acts as an updater - any time a new version of the setup comes out, run it and it will update your setup.

After the installation is done, you can use the graphics configurator created in the game folder to install some of our custom graphics - but this is optional.

If you intend on playing multiplayer with the setup through [GameRanger](https://www.gameranger.com/) - select the modified Extreme executable in (lobbyExplorer)/Edit/Options/Games.
Afterwards, open an Extreme lobby and start the game like normal.
