# Bootstrap Gameplay Guide

v1.9.9a

The guide assumes that the reader has at least basic knowledge of the vanilla game.

The guide also assumes that the official setup with its default settings is being played.

The guide gets more and more generic and unhelpful the further the game has progressed, this is unavoidable as there are increasingly more opportunities to deviate from it while still playing just as effectively.
Don't forget that the best way to learn the game is still just by playing it, or watching how more experienced players play it.

The guide is expected to be deviated from, as the player should create their own playstyle which fits them the best.

You can read the Bootstrap Changelog for more information about specific units and buildings.

## Start of the game

You start the game with no gold, 100 wood, 25 of each food type (100 total) and no starting units - only your lord.

The first thing you want to do, no matter what, is place a granary.
Any spot near your planned food production is good.
If that also happens to be next to your planned stockpile position, even better, but it's not necessary because you can move it later.
Whichever spot you pick - it needs to be easily defendable from raids, as the granary is a very high value target.

Make sure to send your lord out, either to defend the granary or some planned economy/important map control point.

Afterwards, you can set -2 taxes, as the bonus from food variety will cover it.
You can also set -4 taxes, reducing them later when you get to selling some of the food.

Next up - spending your starting wood.

First, get some food production going. Spending 25 to 40 wood on it is generally ideal.
Most of the time, you should start with more basic food production buildings - being apple farms and hunters.
Make sure to season your apple farms if you use them - place half of them, do something else until the trees turn green, then place the rest.
Hunters initially outproduce apple farms, but when deer run out, they're useless. Be careful to place them at least 15 tiles (~1 Cathedral) away from the deer group they are supposed to hunt, and closer to it than to other inaccessible groups - as otherwise they will bug out and go for another group or won't hunt at all.
You can start with a wheat farm, if the following conditions are fulfilled:
- The map has very little farm spots/safe ones, and deer (otherwise, you will get outproduced and be in a disadvantage)
- You have a very safe spot for the wheat farm, which you can place your granary and the stockpile next to
- There is some small amount of deer/few very easy to get spots for apple farms (to supply food for keeping your popularity up, before you can start producing bread)

Next, get a quarry and one ox tether if possible.
It's a great source of early gold and later on you will need the stone to progress your economy.

Use up the rest of your wood on woodcutters - prioritize placing them next to trees in areas which you can easily defend at first.
On resource rich maps, you should prioritize getting 10 to 15 woodcutters for faster later economic expansion.

After spending all of your starting wood, delete and reposition your stockpile to a new safe location in the center of your future economy. Consider these factors for your choice:
- Are your wheat farms producing at maximum efficiency? They are often the bottleneck to your later economy and a cheap and easy source for early gold through selling bread
- Do your iron mines and pitch rigs produce at a good efficiency? 
- Do you have good options to expand and enough room for more economy?
- Can you defend your main economy situated around your stockpile all throughout the game? Is it potentially in range of possible blindspots for tebuchet harassment from your enemy?

You need at least 3 stockpiles, leaving some room for expanding it in the future. The stockpile placement is critical to your entire gameplan - preferably figure one out during a viewing round of the map.

Build a market (it's free), sell some of the food - prioritize selling those types which you are about to produce. Keep about 20 to 50 of it, depending on how much food production you just built.
Don't forget to lower your taxes to -2 now, if you set up -4 initially.

Buy 10 wood, build a mercenary post, get some units - 

Slingers first, about 10 to 20, depending on how open the map is, to defend your economy from slave/assassin raids.
Place them near your economy buildings or on choke points, oftenly it is practical to use one large group in combination with singular spotters to cover a larger area.

Slaves, in case you see an opening to your opponent's economy which you can take advantage of.
Any economy building is a good target for slaves if undefended.
You can also use them to dig moat straight from the start, as moat placement comes with no added costs.

Horse archers, usually just one for early ranged aggressions or to support your slaves against enemy ranged units.
They can distract or kill your opponent's ranged units, making an opening for your slaves.
They can run on a ~5 tile patrol, never getting hit by any far away ranged units, but they can keep shooting back themselves. Use this both offensively and defensively all throughout the game.
Picking off oxen carrying stone to the stockpile or woodcutters carrying wood at range is also worthwhile.

Arabian archers, usually just one, for early firepower against slingers on offense or slaves on defense, assuming you aren't going to face any horse archers.

Assassins, like 1 to 3, depending on how confident you are in your raiding skills. They can break through slingers if sent with the rallypoint flag, or sneak up on more costly ranged units.
Never take on more than 5 slingers for each of your assassins, unless your opponent's attention is elsewhere and they can't defend properly. Avoid all melee units.
Look if you can destroy a quarry or an iron mine, otherwise few woodcutters or hunters will do as well. Killing lots of workers carrying resources is also a decent option.
Of course you don't have to get any in the first place, sometimes there is no way to get value out of them, so the gold is better spent on more defenders.

In case you have gold left over, feel like your defenses are already unbreakable and aren't planning on attacking in any way, you can buy wood for more of the same economy you just built.

You can also build the mercenary post, sell food and get units right after building the granary, if you want to catch your opponent off guard with assassins and such.
It usually doesn't work though, as there is some walk distance in play, so by the time they get there, your opponent will probably already have slingers out.

From this point on, you will be facing constant attacks and raids, be ready to deal with them, while growing your economy and making attacks/raids of your own.

All of the above usually happens in under 2 minutes and it's important that you can do it this fast as well, so get some practice on it.

Assuming you have survived the initial skirmishes, are doing fine or even got a lead on your opponent...

## Earlygame

Spending your first resource deliveries - 

First, take up all the raw resources you can reliably defend from raids.
In decreasing priority, build - quarries, iron mines, woodcutters, hunters, apple farms, pitch rigs.
All of these produce resources which you can sell for gold or use directly to progress your economy.
You can now, but eventually will have to build a hops farm and a dairy farm, to produce beer and leather armor respectively.
If you already have a wheat farm and got your first wheat deliveries in, build a mill and 5 to 8 bakeries.

You can keep selling food for gold, but be careful to not overdo it and lose your popularity.
Buy all the wood needed to expand and run your economy, if your production doesn't suffice.
From this point onwards, think twice before selling any stone - it could be better used for weapon production, beer coverage and religious buildings.

Keep getting mercenaries to fend off attacks and raid the enemy economy.
Consider building the tunneler's guild - tunnelers are very powerful for destroying outer economy buildings when facing little to no resistance or when supported by other units.
Do not overspend on them though - having an army of mercenaries is nice, but not when you will die later on since you fell behind in economy because of it.

If it seems like a good idea - you can use arabian swordsmen to push important map control points. They are especially powerful when sent with the rallypoint flag.
They are also really good as a panic option, in case your lord or economy is in danger and you don't have any weapons, all throughout the game.

Firethrowers can be used from this point onwards to fight lots of melee units, although be careful as they are a risky investment and need a lot of support to be effective.

Some maps also have breakable structures through which you can unlock more resources, some only destructible by tunnelers - consider opening these.

Next up, set up basic weapon production. You can do it straight away if you have resources left over, or you can wait for the next few deliveries.
Set up one fletcher, one poleturner and the armory next to your stockpile. If you have the resources for it, you can get up to 5 of each within the earlygame - prioritize doing this.
The weapons can be sold for extra gold as well, but are generally better used for recruiting an army.
If you at any point overflow with bows and can't use more archers effectively, switch some of your fletchers to produce crossbows to sell them for a bigger profit than bows.

Build the barracks and start recruiting your european archers and spearmen - use them to take control over important points of the map before your opponent does.
You should also send a few units to cover all entry points to your main economy.
If you failed to do so, use your units to hold whatever part of the map is still under your control.

Both european archers and spearmen are cheap and spammable, at this point of the game, you can use a combination of them to fight practically anything.
Slingers are a really good counter to spearmen, you can consider including them in your main army if you lack weapons and need more units

Do not forget lord safety - placing him on your keep, beside your unit rallypoints, a well defended economy building like your granary or walling him in should be done by now.
If your lord has lost any health or you used him to fight off melee units, you can heal him up with an apothecary.
Apothecaries are also useful to generally heal up your army after a fight, later on you can also use them to reduce damage taken from diseased cow shots.

Some maps have unlockable resources or highground positions which you can access with siege towers/laddermen, consider doing this as they oftenly give you a large advantage.

At this point, you can start using the cheaper towers, gates, walls and moat to your advantage if needed.
Pitch ditch and dog cages are also very useful for defending melee attacks if needed, beginning with this point up until the end of the game.

Consider buying 5 hops and setting up beer coverage if you are low on food or want to switch to bread production.
Starting with 2 to 3 breweries is enough.
Alternatively if you have a condensed economy, you can also use chapels for this, they are cheaper but less reliable.

If you have beer/religion coverage or enough food stored, you can consider switching from apple farms to wheat farms.
Initially just one, later on all of them - you can also buy 5 wheat to kickstart the production before you get first wheat deliveries in.
If you placed your granary far away from your stockpile and need to move it - sell all your food, delete it and rebuild it next to your stockpile, ideally right before first bread is made so you don't lose too much popularity.
If you started with a wheat farm, simply continue growing your bread production.

You should also highly consider getting shields if both sides have a larger number of archers, they basically render all ranged units attacking them useless.

There is also a chance that the map has ran out of deer by this point, you can delete the hunters if that's the case, or at least remember to do so in the future.

Next up is upgrading your weapon production - build 1 to 3 blacksmiths, depending on how much iron the map has - no need to cover all of your iron production yet, set them to produce maces.
Now, maces can be sold for huge amounts of gold if needed, but you are better off using them for macemen.
Set up one dairy farm and build a few tanners, they are cheap but take a long time to ramp up their production. One farm usually supports about 8 of them.
It is also good to buy the first leather armor and get macemen before your production kicks in.

Macemen counter all melee units up to this point and are far better at tanking arrows and sling shots than spearmen.
Combine the macemen with your spearmen, your army is now much more capable of pushing enemy control points and raiding. You should make full use of it.

You can consider using rams for early main army pushes, as they are very hard to stop with only melee, and basically unstoppable when supported.

You should have the following set up by now, if you don't, turn around and get it:
- All raw resources which you can control being put to use
- Basic weapon production, fletchers and poleturners
- Bread economy, or at least beginnings of it
- Beer coverage, or at least beginnings of it
- A few blacksmiths producing maces alongside tanners for leather armor
- A small main army of spearmen, archers and few macemen, supported by shields

You can situationally delay getting some of these, but generally you shouldn't, unless you have a really good reason for it.

Assuming you haven't yet won or lost the game completely...

## Middlegame

Larger scale, sometimes even game deciding fights will occur from this point on.
Make sure you take up as much of the map for yourself as possible, keep up the pressure with raids on your enemy's economy and organize full on main army attacks.

Finish your mace production - you should cover most of your iron production with it, leaving only little for utility/later armor production.
Set up or expand your leather armor production, fully using up the capacity of one dairy farm is generally ideal, even if that means overproducing.
Set up full beer coverage and start taxing if you haven't already. Building a second hops farm can also be worthwhile, as otherwise you may end up having to buy extra hops.
Set up bread production if you haven't already, keep growing it until you don't have any more farm spots to switch to wheat farms.

Make sure to keep growing your army - keep adding more european archers, spearmen, macemen and shields.
You should slowly start adjusting the ratio of spearmen to macemen in your army, until it's about 1 to 1. You can sell the excess spears for gold.
You can also start using fireballistas if you have the pitch needed for them, they are great both offensively and defensively to break enemy shields or pick on their units.

By this time you should also have the resources to use some of the more expensive towers along with tower siege engines, if you find yourself defending.
Oil pot engineers can be used defensively or for holding down control points, sort of as mobile pitch ditches.

To take castle defenses down on offense, you should primarily use trebuchets hidden behind cover and protected by your main army.
You can also use them to destroy the defender's inside economy, so they will struggle to put out more units.
Catapults are also usable for this, though they are slightly worse at it, especially if elevation is in play, at the exchange of being far better against shields/units in general.
Throwing diseased cows into enemy crowds of units is also very effective.
Rams can be used to prevent the repairing of a tower, while also damaging it down.
At the same time, you should also cut off their outside stone supplies (and anything else for that matter), so they can't keep repairing their towers and economy.

You can set up stables along with sword/metal armor production at this point, knights are very powerful for raiding outside economy.
They can also snowball their value as most of their cost lies within the stables, you can repeatedly take on melee fights with them and replace them for relatively lower cost when they die.
Avoid spearmen as those are far too cost effective against them, instead target macemen/ranged units, along with enemy economy of course.
If you find yourself defending against knights, use spearmen to cover any entrance points they could have to your economy.

Around this time, you can consider getting the church and the cathedral.
Both provide a permanent popularity boost, which you can use to offset half rations/increase your taxes/generally boost your popularity if you are still struggling with it.
You can also pair them with chapels for an even larger popularity boost, although this is unreliable and not very effective if you have most of your population still running outside of your main economy.

The cathedral also allows you to recruit monks, which you can mass recruit to give yourself an edge in main army melee fights.
They are amazing for fighting anything in melee at this point of the game, but you have to heavily support them as they die to ranged units like nothing.

When european archers start taking up too many peasants or you start facing armored melee units, start switching your fletchers to produce crossbows and start putting out crossbowmen to replace them.
Crossbowmen serve basically the exact same purpose as european archers, just having more power per unit and far better damage to armored units.

Next up you should start switching some of your blacksmiths to produce swords and build armorers to put out european swordsmen. This also frees up leather armor for more crossbowmen.
Swords, and especially metal armor can both be sold for large amounts of gold if needed.
Swordsmen are great against absolutely everything in melee, even monks, while also capable of tanking ranged shots from anything short of a fireballista.

Now, in general, you can consider getting either positive or negative fear factor - 
Positive if you already have lots of army and think the damage boost is worth giving up your economy's power for, or need the extra popularity boost.
Negative if you don't have enough army and really need the extra economic power to catch up or outproduce your opponent.
Neither is really ever required though, both are rather situational.

By this time, you should have:
- Fully set up mace and leather armor production
- Full beer coverage
- The most bread production you can have with your wheat farms
- Set up crossbow production
- Starting sword/metal armor production for european swordsmen

Knights and all the religion buildings are rather optional at this point of the game.

Assuming you still haven't won or lost the game by this point...

## Lategame

Slowly start switching your entire weapon production to put out swordsmen and knights instead of macemen, invest into stables if possible.
Knights in larger numbers can completely control the field and kill anything that doesn't directly counter them.
Their direct counters are spearmen, pikemen and monks, although not so much on said larger numbers if used correctly.
You can use their fast movement speed to stack them very quickly, get a few kills and then click them out of combat, repeating this to pick off smaller numbers of units at once, disallowing any stacking from happening with enemy units.
They still struggle against larger numbers of crossbowmen and fireballistas.

Switch some of your poleturners to produce pikes.
Pikemen are incredibly good at this point of the game, as they are the most tanky melee unit in the game, great as support for your other melee units, and they directly counter knights in melee.
You can sometimes use them to walk up to enemy walls or towers and start taking them down, as they are nearly invincible against arrows and take relatively low damage from fire and killing pits.
Still, you need to be careful about crossbowmen and fireballistas.

Don't be afraid to buy iron to produce metal armor if you need more of it but have too many blacksmiths eating up your iron supplies already, it is worth it for the units, and even lands a small profit if the armor is sold.
You can also build more fletchers if there aren't any more lucrative options left to boost your economy. You then want to buy wood and sell crossbows for profit.

Make sure you have all the paths secured by walls, gates and moat by this point, so no rushing can happen.

Once there is seemingly no way to progress your economy, start getting your final army.
Lategame armies are really varying, make sure to put together whatever seems to work on the spot.

Combinations of macemen, spearmen and monks can still be effective, but you should primarily focus on siege engines like fireballistas and catapults, as well as a good melee army of mainly monks, a few swordsmen and plenty of pikemen.
If your economy allows for it, dominate the fields with a few knight squads that threaten larger damage if your oppoent splits their army or decides to push out and leave their back unprotected.
Your army should then be supported by a large amount of crossbowmen with shields, to counter enemy ranged units.

If you are attacking, build trebuchets and/or catapults, combined with rams to take down any castle defenses in your path.
You might want to also expand your stockpile and stock up on stone in advance, so you don't run out of ammunition, as reloading stone is less costly than building new catapults.
Trebuchets and catapults can also be used defensively.
Whichever side of the siege you are on, the game will most likely end with it.

## General advice

- At all times, no matter what, be careful about your lord. After all, killing him is the only objective of the game. Assassin sneaks or melee rushes on him are far from uncommon.
- Keep applying pressure on your opponent whenever possible, the time they spend defending is time they can't spend on expanding their economy, getting more army or attacking you.
- Have respect for highground - never take a melee fight uphill unless you have far more units, same way never fight ranged units which are uphill or on walls/towers unless you have shields.
- Use all the defender's advantages if you find yourself on defense, especially in your build range - namely highground, towers, pitch ditches and dog cages.
- Use water pots and wells to extinguish fires instead of deleting buildings, unless deleting them is necessary or more practical.
- Make sure to delete unnecessary hunters and woodcutters, so they don't just keep walking into enemy ranged units - losing large amounts of population at an unfortunate moment can cost you the game.
- Use unit rallypoints, either to have them all rally in a convenient spot or for movement benefits - all units ignore ground type slowdowns when sent to their rally flag.
- Learn the basic hotkeys, you can combine them with the CTRL key to not move your screen, if you are selecting buildings with them. The most common ones are M for market, N for mercenary post, B for barracks and the number keys for unit groups.
